/**
 * @title Amp
 * @notice Amp is an ERC20 compatible collateral token designed to support
 * multiple classes of collateralization systems.
 * @dev The Amp token contract includes the following features:
 *
 * Partitions
 *   Tokens can be segmented within a given address by "partition", which in
 *   pracice is a 32 byte identifier. These partitions can have unique
 *   permissions globally, through the using of partition strategies, and
 *   locally, on a per address basis. The ability to create the sub-segments
 *   of tokens and assign special behavior gives collateral managers
 *   flexibility in how they are implemented.
 *
 * Operators
 *   Inspired by ERC777, Amp allows token holders to assign "operators" on
 *   all (or any number of partitions) of their tokens. Operators are allowed
 *   to execute transfers on behalf of token owners without the need to use the
 *   ERC20 "allowance" semantics.
 *
 * Transfers with Data
 *   Inspired by ERC777, Amp transfers can include arbitrary data, as well as
 *   operator data. This data can be used to change the partition of tokens,
 *   be used by collateral manager hooks to validate a transfer, be propagated
 *   via event to an off chain system, etc.
 *
 * Token Transfer Hooks on Send and Receive
 *   Inspired by ERC777, Amp uses the ERC1820 Registry to allow collateral
 *   manager implementations to register hooks to be called upon sending to
 *   or transferring from the collateral manager's address or, using partition
 *   strategies, owned partition space. The hook implementations can be used
 *   to validate transfer properties, gate transfers, emit custom events,
 *   update local state, etc.
 *
 * Collateral Management Partition Strategies
 *   Amp is able to define certain sets of partitions, identified by a 4 byte
 *   prefix, that will allow special, custom logic to be executed when transfers
 *   are made to or from those partitions. This opens up the possibility of
 *   entire classes of collateral management systems that would not be possible
 *   without it.
 *
 * These features give collateral manager implementers flexibility while
 * providing a consistent, "collateral-in-place", interface for interacting
 * with collateral systems directly through the Amp contract.
